              Journalists sometimes expose themselves to danger, particularly
              when reporting in areas of armed conflict or in states that do not
              respect the freedom of the press. Organizations such as the
              Committee to Protect Journalists and Reporters Without Borders
              publish reports on press freedom and advocate for journalistic
              freedom. As of November 2011, the Committee to Protect Journalists
              reports that 887 journalists have been killed worldwide since 1992
              by murder (71%), crossfire or combat (17%), or on dangerous
              assignment (11%). The "ten deadliest countries" for journalists
              since 1992 have been Iraq (230 deaths), Philippines (109), Russia
              (77), Colombia (76), Mexico (69), Algeria (61), Pakistan (59),
              India (49), Somalia (45), Brazil (31) and Sri Lanka (30).[5] The
              Committee to Protect Journalists also reports that as of 1
              December 2010, 145 journalists were jailed worldwide for
              journalistic activities. Current numbers are even higher. The ten
              countries with the largest number of currently-imprisoned
              journalists are Turkey (95),[6] China (34), Iran (34), Eritrea
              (17), Burma (13), Uzbekistan (6), Vietnam (5), Cuba (4), Ethiopia
              (4), and Sudan (3).[7] Apart from physical harm, journalists are
              harmed psychologically. This applies especially to war reporters,
              but their editorial offices at home often do not know how to deal
              appropriately with the reporters they expose to danger. Hence, a
              systematic and sustainable way of psychological support for
              traumatized journalists is strongly needed. However, only little
              and fragmented support programs exist so far.[8]
